Hi, Iâ€™m Patrick Kurth. I'm working as a researcher on analog integrated circuits, more specifically on high-frequency phase-locked loops.
I'm interested in electronic design automation and my biggest project in this regard is [openPCells](https://github.com/patrickschulz/openPCells), a technology-independent layout generator for analog/digital/mixed signal integrated circuits.
Besides that I like working with LaTeX, lua and the command-line, so my other repositories target these things.
